            <h1>Career</h1>
            <h3>Cricketing Journey</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">His supreme ability caught the eye of the selectors as he was fast-tracked into the
                national squad as a
                raw 20-year-old in 2004. He made his Test debut in the home series against England in 2004 and exhibited
                his class with a sublime 52 in just his fourth innings with the bat, saving South Africa from what
                looked like a certain defeat. He also registered his first Test century in the series - a fluent 109 on
                his home ground in Centurion. In short, he'd wasted no time and had shown the world his capability
                immediately.</p>

                <h3>2007 Cricket World Cup in West Indies</h3>

                <p>He made his maiden ODI hundred, 146 from just 130 balls including 5 sixes and 12 fours, in the Super
                    8
                    game against West Indies on 10 April 2007. He had to bat with a runner for the latter stages of his
                    innings and found every shot painful due to a combination of cramps, heat exhaustion and
                    dehydration.[citation needed] His innings consisted of a second wicket partnership of 170 with
                    Jacques
                    Kallis and a third wicket partnership of 70 with Herschelle Gibbs. De Villiers' innings helped set
                    up a
                    total of 356/4 from 50 overs.</p>

                <h3>2011 Cricket World Cup</h3>
                <p>AB de Villiers scored two successive centuries in the 2011 World Cup. He became the first South
                    African
                    to score two centuries in a single World Cup and the fifth batsman after Mark Waugh, Saeed Anwar,
                    Rahul
                    Dravid and Matthew Hayden to score two consecutive centuries in a single World Cup tournament. He
                    also
                    became the 16th batsman to score two or more centuries in one World Cup tournament. AB de Villiers'
                    strike rate of 136.73 is the highest among South African batsmen who have scored centuries in World
                    Cup
                    matches. With his third player of the match award in World Cups, De Villiers is joint second with
                    Jacques Kallis on the list of South African players with most match awards in World Cups. Lance
                    Klusener
                    heads the list with five awards.</p>

                <h3>2015 World Cup</h3>
                <p>De Villiers was one of the top performers at the 2015 Cricket World Cup scoring 482 runs at an
                    average of
                    96.0 and strike rate of 144.0 during the tournament.[34]

                    B, leading South Africa to their second-highest total in World Cup history (408), at Sydney
                    Cricket
                    Ground. With this feat, he became the record holder for the fastest 50, 100 and 150 in One-Day
                    International history.Under the captaincy of De Villiers, South Africa qualified for the
                    semi-finals
                    of
                    the World Cup but lost to New Zealand in the match. De Villiers finished the tournament as the
                    third-highest run-scorer with 482 runs, behind Martin Guptill and Kumar Sangakkara.At the end of
                    the
                    tournament, he was ranked number 1 in the ICC batsmen rating in One day International cricket
                    and
                    number
                    3 in the ICC batsmen rating in Test cricket.[35] He was named in the 'Team of the Tournament'
                    for
                    the
                    2015 World Cup by the ICC.</p>
